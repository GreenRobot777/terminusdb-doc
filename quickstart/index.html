<h2 id="what-is-terminushub-and-how-does-it-work">What is TerminusHub and how does it work?</h2>

<p>TerminusDBs are linked through TerminusHub. The hub allows the user to manage access to databases and to collaboratively work on shared resources. You can make changes to a database, push them to hub and have a collaborator pull the synced version of the database.</p>

<p>You can share and collaborate on curated data sets in a distributed manner using git-like operations (push, pull, fetch, clone, fork)</p>

<p>Collaboration is easy with clone/fork allowing data to be moved to your cloud or servers</p>

<p>Merge and branch operations let you mix and match data sources significantly simplifying integration tasks.</p>
