# Taking TerminusDB to the Bank

{: .no_toc }

TerminusDB is designed to enable collaboration and revision control on data assets. While git is a fantastic piece of software, it is really designed for code management, and not data management. We bring that power to the world of data.

In order to get a feel for how these collaboration features work, we can start with a classic database management problem. The bank account balance.

## Step 2 - Push, Pull and Branch Management

In the first installment, we created a branch_office branch where we added some data. But the strength of the distributed model of TerminusDB is that others can work on data assets in parallel. To make use of this powerful feature, we need to make alterations in a different database.

Since we are using collaboration features, first you will need to log into hub. It is easy and you can do it from your console by pressing 'Connect to Hub' in the top right corner.
