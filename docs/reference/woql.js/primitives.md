# Reference Guides

The reference section is information driven. Our structure tries to mirror the code base to make it easier to connect to work. It is designed to be consumed in 'doing mode' while working with TerminusDB and TerminusHub. 

Reference material provides technical descriptions of the mechanics of the database. They should be austere and to the point with lists and examples of variation of parameter usage. This is not the place for broader descriptive content. 

We are always trying to improve so let us know if there are errors or improvement we could make. And feel free to contribute.
