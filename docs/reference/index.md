# Reference

This section is designed to help you understand TerminusDB and TerminusHub. It is normally consumed while in 'doing' mode. 

What matters here is technical description of the machinary so you can work out what to do while you are working. It should be consistent and austere. This is not the place for discussion of problems or conceptual explanations. 

We are always trying to improve, so let us know if the content can be better or if you have a contribution.
