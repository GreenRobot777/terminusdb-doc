# Web Components

The TerminusDB Console is a ReactJS application that provides users with an interface for managing and querying TerminusDB. TerminusDB Console is included when you run TerminusDB, so you won't normally need to run this on your own unless you are a developer of TerminusDB.

TerminusDB Server references this from the index page served when you access the Console from the built in webserver, on `http://127.0.0.1:6363/console` by default.
