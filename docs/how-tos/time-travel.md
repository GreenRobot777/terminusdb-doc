###### TerminusDB

TerminusDB is a temporal database and natively supports time travel. It offers temporal data types and stores information relating to the past states of the database. TerminusDB uses a delta encoding approach to facilitate time travel queries. You can read more about this in [this technical white paper](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-server/blob/dev/docs/whitepaper/terminusdb.pdf).
